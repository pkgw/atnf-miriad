*  maxdimc.h - C include file containing MIRIAD-wide parameters.
*
*  Note that MAXBUF defined here is only used by the routines in xyzio.c
*  which are only used by a handful of tasks.  It is NOT the same as the
*  MAXBUF defined for Fortran use in maxdim.h and only needs to be large
*  enough for efficient I/O.  xyzio always allocates two buffers, one int
*  and the other float, using malloc() for up to the maximum number of
*  elements specified by MAXBUF.  The default value allows 64MiB each for
*  4-byte ints and floats each should be plenty.
*
*  The remaining parameters must match those in maxdim.h, or maxnax.h for
*  MAXNAX.
*
*  MAXDIM is only used by the xyio.c routines.
*
*  MAXNAX is only used by the xyio.c, xyzio.c and xyziowrap.c routines.
*
*  MAXANT and MAXWIN are only used by the uvio.c routines.
*
*  MAXBASE, MAXCHAN, and MAXWIDE are not used by anything.
