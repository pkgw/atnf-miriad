C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C     Size of an INTEGER array used to implement a memory heap.  This
C     array is the sole variable in blank COMMON in Miriad.  Trial-and-
C     error compilations on an x86-64 system with gcc/g77 show that the
C     limit on MAXBUF for which most tasks build successfully is
C     1073741823 (2**30 - 1) which corresponds to 4GiB.  With MAXDIM
C     less than 32768 the limit for which all tasks build successfully
C     is about 260000000; unsuccessful links produce messages about
C     truncated relocations, imom being the worst offender.
C     The default value allocates 128MiB (for normal 4-byte INTEGERs).
      INTEGER   MAXBUF
      PARAMETER(MAXBUF = 32*1024*1024)

C     Maximum image axis length.  Array dimensions are typically a few
C     times MAXDIM (never MAXDIM**2) so MAXDIM is associated with a much
C     smaller allocation of static memory than MAXBUF.  Thus the default
C     value of MAXDIM is quite generous.  Values of MAXDIM > 32767 cause
C     segvs in mfclean.  Note that, depending on the algorithm, MAXBUF
C     may also play an important role in determining the maximum image
C     size that can be handled.
      INTEGER   MAXDIM
      PARAMETER(MAXDIM = 16*1024)

C     Maximum number of antennas (SCAMP=96).
      INTEGER   MAXANT
      PARAMETER(MAXANT = 96)

C     Maximum number of baselines, including autocorrelations.
      INTEGER   MAXBASE
      PARAMETER(MAXBASE = ((MAXANT*(MAXANT+1))/2))

C     Maximum number of channels in spectral data.
      INTEGER   MAXCHAN
      PARAMETER(MAXCHAN = 70000)

C     Maximum number of windows in visibility data.
      INTEGER   MAXWIN
      PARAMETER(MAXWIN = 16)

C     Maximum number of wideband channels.
      INTEGER   MAXWIDE
      PARAMETER(MAXWIDE = 18)
