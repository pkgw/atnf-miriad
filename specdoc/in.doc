%A in
	This is the standard name for an input dataset -- usually
	an image, though sometimes either an image or visibility dataset
	or some foreign dataset format. Some tasks support multiple
	input datasets at a time (with wildcard supported) whereas
	others can handle only a single one at a time. There is
	generally no default input name.
