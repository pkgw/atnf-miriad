tpcp is a utility to copy to or from a tape.

Usage:
  tpcp [-b blocksize] in out

where "in" is the input, which may be either a disk file or a tape
device. Similarly "out" may be either a file or a tape device. 

If the input is a file and the output is a tape device, the "-b"
flag should be used to set the block size of write operations.

Example:
  Tape-to-tape copy:    tpcp /dev/nrst0 /dev/nrst1
  Tape-to-disk copy:	tpcp /dev/nrst0 data.fits
  Disk-to-tape copy:	tpcp -b 2880 data.fits /dev/nrst0
