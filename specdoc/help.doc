    help <topic>
  for information about a specific topic.

  The "miriad" shell is a command-line front-end to run Miriad tasks.
  The commands that you give it are somewhat AIPS-like.
  Unrecognised commands are passed to the host command interpreter, so
  you can use the normal host commands within the shell (with occasional
  caveats).

  The following are the recognised commands:

    set <key> <value>          Set or show a keyword.
    <key>=<value>              Set a keyword.
    unset <key> [<key> ... ]   Unset keyword(s).
    er <key>                   Line-edit a keyword value.
    task [<task>]              Set/show default task.
    inp [<task>]               Show settings of keywords to task.
    go [-b] [<task>]           Run a task.
    help [<task>] [-k key]     Help on a task or topic.
    view [<task>]              Edit keyword file for task.
    save/load [file]           Save/load global keyword file.
    tget/tput [-l] [<task>]    Save/load task keyword file.
    setenv env value           Set environment variable.
    unsetenv env               Unset environment variable.
    cd <dir>                   Change and/or show current directory
    source <file>              Read commands from <file>
    exit                       Exit miriad and save variables.
