20nov98 heb/rjs uvflux.for -- Added options=uvpol to print out linear polarization
		parameters.
20nov98 rjs	fits.for -- Better handling of some projections and also
		handle sky rotation.
20nov98 rjs	co.for,co.h,regrid.for,headcopy.for -- Handling of sky rotation.
25nov98 rjs	regrid.for -- Better handling of sky rotation.
25nov98 rjs	prthd.for,imsub.for -- Handling of sky rotation.
18nov98 mchw	gpedit.for -- Added options=scale.
25nov98 rjs	cgcurs.for -- Fix compaction algorithm again!
25nov98 rjs	fits.for -- Lots of fiddles regarding reading/writing image
		coordinate systems.
30nov98 rjs	maths.for -- Added options=grow, which "grows" of dummy axes
		to the size of other non-dummy axes.
30nov98 nebk    cgsubs.for -- Finally invent a decent algorithm for razerocg
01dec98 rjs	selfcal.for,gpscal.for,uvmodel.for -- More warning messages.
01dec98 rjs	gpedit.for -- Added options=dup.
02dec98 rjs	maths.for,ari.for -- Quadrupled the size of a stack buffer.
04dec98 rjs	tin.for,tin.h -- Better error messages.
15dec98 rjs	cgsubs.for -- Some tidying.
21dec98 nebk    atmos.for -- The binary was not atmos !  It said it was atmos,
                   version 1.0 from Feb 1996, but I can't work out whatsource
                   that was from.  It gave an error message that did appear
                   to be releavent to atmos.  I pushed MAXSCAL up to 500
                   in atmos.h (arbitary as I don't know what it does)
06jan99 rjs	cgsubs.for -- Yet again another try at a decent algorithm for
		razerocg.
07jan99 rjs	fits.for -- Write dates in new FITS form.
