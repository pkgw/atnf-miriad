15dec98 rjs	cgsubs.for -- Some tidying.
21dec98 nebk    atmos.for -- The binary was not atmos !  It said it was atmos,
                   version 1.0 from Feb 1996, but I can't work out whatsource
                   that was from.  It gave an error message that did appear
                   to be releavent to atmos.  I pushed MAXSCAL up to 500
                   in atmos.h (arbitary as I don't know what it does)
06jan99 rjs	cgsubs.for -- Yet again another try at a decent algorithm for
		razerocg.
07jan99 rjs	fits.for -- Write dates in new FITS form.
08jan99 rjs	co.for -- Better handling of sky/grid rotation, and corrections
		to cogaucvt when pixel increments differ and gaussian axis is
		non-zero.
08jan99 rjs	imstat.for,imspec.for -- Change coordinate conversion to use
		the co routines (which also fixes a bug converting RAs).
12jan99 rjs	uvgen.for,blflag.for -- Doc change only.
15jan99 rjs	ephem.for -- Added new leap second.
19jan99 rjs	mosmem.for -- It was failing to access the correct single dish plane!!
20jan99 rjs	mfcal.for -- The frequency assosicated with a channel was
		being incorrectly determined when the line "width" and "step"
		parameters differed.
25jan99 rjs	fitsio.for -- The uv FITS writer was still writing in the old
		date format.
22jan99 rjs	mosmem.for -- Fudge to get the rms noise information to propogate
		through correctly for single pointing work.
27jan99 rjs	invert.for -- Change the default "line" parameter to all
		channels.
29jan99 rjs	mossdi.for -- Fix up a message.
