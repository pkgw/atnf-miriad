A few tasks require ATCA weather data for their operation. To
get the appropriate data, go to the ATCA's monthly weather data page

http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/cgi-bin/Weather/hisdata.cgi

Using your browser, download the data file for the appropriate month.

If available, you might look at the plot for the month.
The plot file shows temperature and "wet path" (roughly proportional
to zenith opacity) plots. It shows three sets of readings - black
line, red line and big green dots - which in principle should all
agree (roughly). There is a systematic difference between the black
and red sensors. The red sensor is attached to the control building,
is moderated by the building and so shows less diurnal fluctuation.
The black is freestanding in the weather tower, and is the sensor we tend
to believe. The green dots are measurements at Narrabri airport.

If the black line/dots in these plots shows normal diurnal cycling
around the time of your observation, then you are in good shape. If it
shows a flat line or nothing ... then the data are probably bad and
something went wrong with the monitoring/archiving of the weather
data.

The files are in AEST times.  If you observe over an AEST month change -
you will need to download the two months, and concatenate them together. 

The data files are updated nightly.
