%A telescop
	This keyword gives the name of an telescope (or perhaps more
	liberally by some tasks, an observatory or a primary beam type).
	Some values include:
	  ATCA     The Australia Telescope Compact Array (Narrabri)
	  PARKES   The Parkes telescope.
	  MOPRA    The Mopra telescope.
	  HATCREEK BIMA's Hat Creek Observatory.
	  VLA      NRAO's Very Large Array
	  WSRT     NFRA's Westerbork telescope.
	Other possible values are given by the ``telepar'' task
	(without giving any parameters).
