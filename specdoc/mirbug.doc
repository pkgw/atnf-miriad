%D Send mail about bugs to appropriate person
%P rjs
%: user utility
%B
  Usage: mirbug [-r] [-b] taskname [file]

  Mirbug allows the user to send bug reports to the appropriate people.

  mirbug creates a template report or prepends it to the optional file
  and then starts an editor. The editor is that indicated by the VISUAL
  or EDITOR environment variable, or vi if neither environment variable
  is set.

  After exiting the editor the user is given the option of not mailing
  the report by using ^C. If this is not done within 5 seconds, the
  report is mailed to the person responsible, to a central address and
  to the sender. If ^C is used, the report is saved.

  Arguments:

    taskname should be one of the miriad tasks/tools/scripts or the
             string 'general'.

    file     (optional) is the name of a previously created file containing
             the report. This must be the second argument.

    -r       The -r switch causes mirbug to run the task, and include
             any output in the template bug report.

    -b       Do not invoke an editor -- just mail the template.
