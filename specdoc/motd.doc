	There is a new program called "cgrego" which converts
	polygonal region text files (as written by "cgcurs") into
	overlay files (as read by "cgdisp").  Thus you can (finally)
	plot a previously region on an image.  Will this
	be the last "cg" program ???

	A new task, clfind, to decompose a spectral cube into a
	collection of clumps has been installed. Further information
