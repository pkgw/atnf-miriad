	Use options=noauto in atlod
	===========================
	A minor bug in new ATCA correlator software (introduced in
	December 2000) means that RPFITS files can erroneously contain
	autocorrelation data. This occurs only when averaging is used
	on-line. These autocorrelations should be ignored. Many Miriad
	tasks do indeed ignore these autocorrelations - where this makes
	sense. However, it is suggested that you use the "noauto" option
	of "atlod" to discard any autocorrelations early on, and so
	avoid any confusion.
