Mosaicing Bug:
==============
A bug has just been corrected in "invert" which affects multi-channel
mosaics (it does not affect mosaics where the output is a single plane or
or cubes made from a single pointing even if options=mosaic was used). 
The bug is a misregistration of pointings by up to a half a pixel.
Each pointing and each plane will have a different "random" error. Please
contact me if you think this bug might have affected you significantly.

Year 2000 Issues:
=================
Miriad should not have any problems with the coming of the year 2000.
The final modifications to Miriad to handle the changes to the FITS and RPFITS
date formats were distributed in January 1999.

You will note that the format that you use to specify an absolute time (mostly
in visibility data selection) includes a two-digit year format (e.g. 99oct29
for 29th October 1999). This two-digit year selects within the century
1940 to 2039. There are some years before this should become an issue.
So 00jan01 will correspond to 1st January 2000.
