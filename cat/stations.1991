        INTERFEROMETER ANTENNA POSITIONS FOR 1991

File: mircat/stations.1991

The date indicates when the last update for each antenna configuration,
and should correspond to date when antennas were moved to new stations.
T/F indicates baselines in this table are good/bad.
Columns 3,4,5 give antenna positions relative to station 9. The
	antenna positions are also in the uvdata and can be listed
	with the Miriad task uvlist options=var
Columns 7,8,9 give baseline vectors from antenna i to antenna j
	(baseline ij = antenna j - antenna i); these numbers are
	typed out by CBEE when data is read in or edited.

If the antenna positions in your uvdata do not agree with those in the table
you may need to edit the uvdata before fitting a phase correction file to your
calibrator data points.

This can be done with the Miriad tasks UVEDIT, CALFLAG, CALFIT and CALAPPLY, or
using the Ralint task CBEE and CALIBRATE. Reading in the file CBEE.date for the
baseline fit will automatically edit calibrator data in CBEE before the fits
are done. CALIBRATE will then make these baseline corrections to your data.

Summary

During the B-array we noticed significant changes in the pointing and 
interferometer baseline. This is a new problem and may be related to
interaction between the antenna stations and the new concrete roadway during
the cold weather. This is a problem we have to fix. The data should be 
inspected carefully and the corrections given below may help.

Baselines for B-array

We obtain baseline data and fit the baseline before starting to
observe, so that the uvdata should have the correct baseline, and there
should not be phase jumps between calibrators. If there are phase jumps
between calibrators, then there may also be phase jumps between the
calibrator and the source and one can not reliably remove the instrumental
phase by fitting the calibrator phase. One must first edit the data to the
correct baseline, which should remove phase jumps between calibrators, unless
there is a focus change or another instrumental problem.

BASELINE.09JAN 11Jan, 16jan
We saw large pointing and baseline changes during this configuration. Up to
and including 06jan the original baseline seems adequate.
Specifically from the observers notes we have:

05jan:
n628co	- jump due to focus change
n2903	- not too bad.
sgrb2sc18oi - trends on baseline 2 3. Phase jump between 3c273 and nra530 not
removed by baseline change.

06jan
s98w58 not bad; cbee.09jan does not improve it.
irc10216cn - not too bad
ic443hcop - OK, cals close to source.

data on 08 09 jan are correctable with baseline from 09jan.

09jan
obar13co - still have 1 radian jump on baseline 12 23 ok on 31
l1287hcom - OK
n3627 - ok
omnmc0 - good new baseline removes phase jump on baseline 31 between
3c84 an pk0420

10jan is already corrected.

11jan should use baseline.11jan

12-16 jan were a washout.

on 16jan the antenna were reshimmed and a new baseline installed. Data should
be OK.

How to apply the corrections.

a) Using CBEE, the CBEE.date files may be copied directly from HAT::du:[
data.baseline] and will edit the data to the new baseline before you fit
instrumental phase. The new baseline and phase fit w.r.t that baseline are
automatically applied to the data when you calibrate the data.

b) Using UVEDIT. One must first edit the calibrator to the new baseline,
then fit the phase to the edited file using CALMAKE, CALFLAG, and CALFIT.
Run CALAPPLY to see if worked.
Then UVEDIT the source data.
Then run CALAPPLY on the edited source data.

Conclusion.

Care will be needed to calibrate during this period. If you have comments
or data which will help other observers, please send me a copy.

	Also look at the observing logs for further information.
